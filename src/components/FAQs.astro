        What's the Difference Between Part 141 and Part 61 Training?
      </dt>
      <dd class="mt-4 text-sm/6 text-gray-600">
        Part 141 and Part 61 refer to different sections in the FAA regulations.
        Part 141 is a more structured and rigorous training program that is
        designed for schools that are approved by the FAA to provide training
        under specific curricula. Part 61, on the other hand, is a more flexible
        training program that allows for individualized training plans; however
        being less structured, students may require more hours to complete Part
        61 training.
