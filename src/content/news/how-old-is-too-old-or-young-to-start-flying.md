If you live near St. Louis and want to become a pilot, you might ask, "Am I too old or too young to start flying?" The short answer is no. Age does not have to be a barrier. You can begin flight training at many stages of life.

## How Young Can You Start Flight Training?

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows students to start flying lessons at any age. However, to fly solo in an airplane, you must be at least 16 years old. To earn your private pilot certificate, you need to be at least 17 years old.

At Ideal Aviation, we train students as young as 15 to prepare for their first solo flight. If you want to begin training before you turn 16, you can still take lessons with an instructor and get a head start.

Our instructors teach students the basics of flying, safety, and how to work with checklists and flight controls. Learning early helps build skills that make solo flying easier when the time comes.

## Can Adults Start Flight Training Later in Life?

Yes. There is no maximum age to start flight training. Many students begin in their 40s, 50s, and even 60s. At Ideal Aviation, we have helped adults of all ages learn to fly.

The FAA does require a medical exam for most pilot certificates. If you can pass the required medical exam, you can fly. We can help you understand the process and find a certified medical examiner near the St. Louis area.

Older students often do well in flight training. They bring life experience and focus to the learning process. If flying has always been your dream, it is not too late to start.

## Is Flight Training Safe for Younger or Older Students?

Safety is our top priority. Our instructors follow all FAA safety guidelines and training standards. We also use well-maintained aircraft and simulators to make training safe for every age group.

For younger students, we build confidence through one-on-one instruction. For older students, we adjust training to match physical comfort and learning pace.

Ideal Aviation is a Part 61 and Part 141 FAA-approved school. This means our programs meet high safety and quality standards.
