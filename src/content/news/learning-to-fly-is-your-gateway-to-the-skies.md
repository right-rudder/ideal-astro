Learning to fly opens the door to exciting opportunities. Whether you want to fly for fun, work for an airline, or serve in the military, it all starts with good training. If you’re in the St. Louis area or Southern Illinois, Ideal Aviation is here to guide you every step of the way. We combine classroom learning and hands-on flying at St. Louis Downtown Airport (KCPS) to help you achieve your goals.

Most pilots begin with a Private Pilot License (PPL). This teaches the basics of flying, how to navigate, and how airplanes work. After getting a PPL, many pilots earn an Instrument Rating (IR) to fly safely in bad weather conditions, a crucial skill when flying around St. Louis and the Midwest.

If you want to fly for a living, the next step is a Commercial Pilot Certificate. Ideal Aviation also offers programs for becoming a flight instructor, giving you a chance to gain experience and help others learn to fly. Pilots aiming for airline careers work toward an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate, the highest level of certification in aviation.

Located just minutes from downtown St. Louis, Ideal Aviation serves aspiring pilots from Missouri, Illinois, and beyond. Our programs combine ground school, flight time, and simulator training to prepare you for success. Learning to fly takes effort, but seeing the Mississippi River and Gateway Arch from the cockpit makes it all worth it.
