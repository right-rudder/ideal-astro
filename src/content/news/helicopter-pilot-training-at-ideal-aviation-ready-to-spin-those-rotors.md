At Ideal Aviation, we can make your dreams of becoming a helicopter pilot a reality! We're the only FAA approved Part 141 helicopter flight school in the St. Louis area, so you know you're getting the best quality training. Whether you're just starting out or looking to obtain advanced flight training certificates and ratings, we've got a program for you.

## From Zero to Hero: Helicopter Pilot Certifications

We'll take you from newbie to pro, one step at a time:

- **Private Pilot Helicopter Certificate:** This is where it all begins! Get your hands on the controls and learn the basics of flying a helicopter. We have very modern fleet of Guimbal helicopters.  We'll cover everything in ground school (aerodynamics, navigation, weather – the whole nine yards) and get you up in the air. To obtain your private pilot, you'll need at least 40 hours (30 with an instructor, 10 on your own).

- **Instrument Rating:** Want to fly in more challenging weather? This rating is your ticket. It teaches you how to use instruments to navigate, which is super important for professional pilots. Expect around 40 hours of dual instruction focused on instrument flying and cross countries.

- **Commercial Pilot Helicopter Certificate:** Ready to make a career out of flying helicopters? This certificate is what you need. You'll learn advanced maneuvers and the professional skills required for commercial operations. You'll need at least  additional flight time, including specific hours for pilot-in-command (PIC) and cross country flights.

- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) / Certified Flight Instructor – Instrument (CFII):** Want to share your love of flying? Become an instructor! The CFI program teaches you how to train new pilots, and the CFII lets you teach instrument flying too. It's a great way to give back to the aviation community.
