## Types of Pilot Licenses

There are different types of pilot licenses, and each has its own requirements:

- **Private Pilot License (PPL):** This is the most common license. It typically takes **3 to 6 months** to earn, depending on your availability and dedication.
- **Instrument Rating (IR):** An additional certification for flying in low visibility. Adding this can take **1 to 3 months** after earning your PPL.
- **Commercial Pilot License (CPL):** This license allows you to fly professionally. It generally takes **6 to 12 months**, building on your PPL and IR.
- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI):** If you want to teach others to fly, this will add a few more months to your training.

## Factors That Affect Training Time

Several factors can influence how quickly you complete your pilot training:

### 1. **Flight School Schedule**

Ideal Aviation offers flexible scheduling to accommodate students with varying time commitments. Full-time students can complete training faster than part-time students.

### 2. **Weather Conditions**

Training at St. Louis Downtown Airport in Sauget, IL, means dealing with Midwestern weather. Some months are better for consistent flight practice, while others may experience delays.

### 3. **Frequency of Lessons**

The more often you train, the faster you’ll progress. Flying 2-3 times a week helps retain skills and reduces the overall time needed.

### 4. **Student Preparedness**

Studying ground school material ahead of lessons ensures you're ready for flight training. Ideal Aviation provides resources to help students succeed.

## Estimated Training Hours

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has minimum flight hour requirements, but most students need more time to become proficient:

- **PPL:** Minimum 40 hours (usually takes closer to 60-70 hours)
- **CPL:** Minimum 250 hours

At Ideal Aviation, we work with you to build your skills efficiently while meeting all FAA standards.
